One of my goals as a developer is integrating different web technologies to enrich my life. 

Using an ESP8266 connected to a soil moisture sensor, I am able to monitor my plants water needs. 

### Still hooking up the ESP8266 to Firebase...In the meantime, check out the React App. I have the soil moisture set on a random number...so you can get a gist of how the app would react to different watering alerts. 

#### Current Conditions is based in Charlotte, NC (where i'm located).
